Hi there! I'm Alejandro. I have a bachelor in Economics from Diego Portales University (UDP). My interests lie in the areas of Financial Economics, Financial Markets, Asset Pricing and Valuation, Macroeconomics, among others. Also I'm very fond of coding in Python and R. Currently I'm studying for the CFA exam (level I) that I will take in november 2021.

In this site you will be able download the exercises that I taught as a Teacher Assistant.
