Hi there! My name is Alejandro Poblete and I'm a fifth year student of Economics at Diego Portales University (UDP). My interest are in the fields of Financial Economics, markets, macroeconomics and economic theory. Also i'm very fond in coding with Python and R, I always try to learn more and try to apply it to Finances and economics, which is quite interesting.

I have been a Teacher Assistant in the subjects of Dynamic Optimization, Principles of Macroeconomics and Finances. In this blog yo will be able to see and download the exercises, so feel free to ask any question about it. This semester (1-2020) I will be teaching Dynamic Optimization, Microecomics II and Industrial Organization.

This is the second page that I do, for pasts TA's you may refer to: https://alejandropblte.github.io/
