Here I show how to compute a General Equilibrum Model in R.
Consider an economy with two agents (A and B) and 3 Goods (i= 1,2,3). The preferences of each consumers are:

x
x
x

Where βA = (1; 2; 4) y βB = (1; 2; 5) are utility coeficients y u(∗) the utility that each good provides to the consumer. The initial endowments are: wA = (0; 100; 0) and wB = (100; 100; 100) and the price of good one is the numeraire (price of good 1 is 1).
Write a function to compute the GE of the economy. Consider the utility is given by: u(ci) = c^{1-γ}/1- γ , with γ=0.5
