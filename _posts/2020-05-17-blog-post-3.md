Channels
=============
Some youtube channels I like to watch:

hosted mainly by Josh Brown and Michael Batnick of Ritholtz Wealth Management.

interviews with iconics financiers, including Robert Shiller, Eugene Fama, William Sharpe, Henry Markowitz, among others. Its hosted by Andew Lo from MIT.

Books
=======
Some books I recommend:
* Shiller, Robert. Finance and the Good Society, 2012.
  - This book describes the beauty of finance and how can finances markets, when they work properly, contribute to a better society.
  He begins describing the role of each participant in the industry and then analyzes the discontents in finances. He argues about the flaws of the financial industry and proposes solutions.
* Nasar, Sylvia. A Beautiful Mind, 1998.
  -  I highly recomend this book because is an amazing story. It is the biography of John Forbes Nash, a mathematician winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994 for his contributions in Non Cooperative Games.
* Acemoglu, Daron and Robinson, James. Why Nations Fail, 2012.
* Levitt, Steven and Dubner, Stephen. Freakonomics, 2005.
