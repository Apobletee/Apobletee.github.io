This is the first course in Macroeconomics. Here you will learn the basics and a framework for future Macroeconomic courses. These basics includes GDP, Inflation, balance of payments, IS-LM (as well as fiscal and monetary policies) and Aggregated Supply and Demand. Good luck and if you have any question just ask me!
